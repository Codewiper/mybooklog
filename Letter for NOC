Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request permission to contribute an article to a special issue of IEEE Computer, a journal published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.

The special issue focuses on "Revisiting Software Testing," and I believe my participation would be valuable both for my professional development and for ABCD's reputation in the tech industry. The journal, accessible at www.computer.org, is widely respected in the field of computer science and engineering.

I want to assure you that the article I intend to write will not be derived from or related to my daily work at ABCD. Instead, it will draw on my general expertise and knowledge in the field of software testing. This opportunity will allow me to support the broader tech industry while indirectly enhancing ABCD's brand as an employer of skilled professionals who contribute to the larger tech community.

To formalize this request, I am seeking a "No Objection" statement from ABCD, confirming that the company has no issues with my participation in this writing process, provided it does not interfere with my regular job responsibilities and does not disclose any proprietary information.

I believe this opportunity aligns with ABCD's commitment to fostering innovation and supporting employee growth. My contribution to this respected journal could potentially enhance our company's reputation as a leader in the tech industry.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response and would be happy to discuss this further if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

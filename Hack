Nice project — clear goal and workflow. Below is a compact, actionable design + implementation plan you can drop into a repo and iterate from. Includes suggested tools, data models, chunking algorithm, approval flow, metadata format, change detection, and example outputs (.context files + metadata).

⸻

1 — High-level architecture
	•	Crawler/Ingester: pulls Confluence pages (metadata + body), OpenAPI/Swagger, markdown repos, platform-standards docs, and diagrams (VSDX/Draw.io/SVG/PNG/JPG).
	•	Staging store: raw extracted artifacts (HTML/MD/JSON/images) for lead review.
	•	Lead Approval UI / Git review: leads pick pages/sections to approve. Approved items move to Processing. (Keep approvals as PRs or a small web UI that writes approval records to git or DB.)
	•	Processor: text extraction → chunker (~500–800 chars) → enrich (category, tags, source URL, timestamps, hashes) → produce detailed & summary chunks.
	•	Context emitter: writes .context/*.md files + metadata mapping JSON into a Git repo.
	•	Change detector: scheduled job compares Confluence/Swagger hashes + modified dates → opens PR / notifies leads for changed pages.
	•	IDE consumption: Copilot reads .context files from repo; snippets contain clickable source URLs.

2 — Recommended tech stack (fast setup)
	•	Confluence API client: Atlassian REST (Python atlassian-python-api) or Node confluence-api.
	•	OpenAPI: openapi-spec-validator + pyyaml or swagger-parser (Node).
	•	Doc extraction: pandoc for docs, python-docx if needed.
	•	Diagrams: unoconv/LibreOffice or vsdx parser; render to SVG and apply XML parse; fallback OCR with Tesseract for PNG/JPG.
	•	Text processing: Python (fast prototyping) — beautifulsoup4, nltk (or just regex), langchain-style chunker logic.
	•	Storage/CI: Git for .context files + GitHub Actions for scheduled change detection & PR automation.
	•	Lead UI: Minimal web UI (React + small backend) OR leverage GitHub PR + CODEOWNERS for approvals.

3 — Chunking & tagging algorithm (concise)
	•	Normalize HTML → plain text. Remove boilerplate (nav, headers).
	•	Split by logical boundaries: headings (H1..H4), bullet blocks, code blocks, table rows.
	•	For each logical block produce chunks sized 500–800 characters; prefer breaking at sentence boundaries.
	•	Tagging heuristics:
	•	If block under heading containing API, endpoint, POST, GET → API Reference.
	•	If contains Saga, Naming, Prefix → Platform Standards.
	•	If OpenAPI path → OpenAPI.
	•	If diagram detected → Diagram (include image path + extracted text).
	•	Produce two variants per chunk:
	•	detailed: full chunk text (up to 800 chars), source, url, last_modified, chunk_id, category, sha256.
	•	summary: 1–2 sentence compressed summary, source, url, sha256(summary).

4 — File layout & content examples

Recommended repo structure:

/payment-context/
  .context/
    api_card_transaction.detailed.md
    api_card_transaction.summary.md
    platform_saga_standards.summary.md
  metadata/
    chunks.json      <-- mapping chunk_id → source, ts, sha256, approved_by
  staging/
    raw_confluence/...
  scripts/
    ingest.py
    process.py
    detect_changes.py
  .github/workflows/change_detect.yml

Example .context/api_card_transaction.detailed.md

[Category: API Reference]
POST /api/card/transaction endpoint accepts JSON payload with card details, amount, and currency. Performs validation, fraud checks, and balance verification before payment execution. Returns ERR_102 when balance insufficient.

Chunk-ID: chunk_20250730_0001
SHA256: e3b0c44298fc1c149...

Example metadata/chunks.json (one entry)

{
  "chunk_20250730_0001": {

    "category": "API Reference",
    "source_url": "https://confluence.bank/payment/card-payment",
    "approved_by": "lead.jane",
    "approved_at": "2025-07-31T09:12:00Z",
    "sha256": "e3b0c44298fc1c149...",

5 — Minimal ingestion + chunking pseudocode (Python)

# high-level pseudocode (implement with concrete libs)
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import hashlib, textwrap, requests
def fetch_confluence_page(url, auth):
    r = requests.get(url, auth=auth)
    return r.text, r.headers.get('Last-Modified')

def html_to_blocks(html):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    # prefer headings and accompanying paragraphs
    blocks = []
    for h in soup.find_all(['h1','h2','h3','h4']):
        text = h.get_text().strip()
        para = ''
        for sib in h.find_next_siblings():
            if sib.name and sib.name.startswith('h'): break
            para += ' ' + sib.get_text(separator=' ')
        blocks.append((text + '\n' + para).strip())
    return blocks

def chunk_text(block, min_size=500, max_size=800):
    # split at sentence boundaries, fallback to word-wrap
    sentences = block.split('. ')
    chunks, cur = [], ''
    for s in sentences:
        if len(cur) + len(s) + 2 <= max_size:
            cur = (cur + '. ' + s).strip() if cur else s
        else:
            chunks.append(cur.strip())
            cur = s
    if cur: chunks.append(cur.strip())
    # merge too-small chunks
    out=[]
    for c in chunks:
        if out and len(out[-1]) + len(c) +1 <= max_size:
            out[-1] = out[-1] + ' ' + c
        else:
            out.append(c)
    return out

def sha256_text(s): return hashlib.sha256(s.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

Use that as the basis and extend with category tagging + summary generation (simple heuristics or a concise summarizer).

6 — Approval & governance (practical)
	•	Staging → PR: ingestion writes staging/<page>.md and opens a GitHub PR. Leads review and label approved or request changes. Approved PR merges → CI runs Processor to generate .context files and metadata entries.
	•	Audit trail: store approved_by, approved_at, source_sha in metadata. Keep original source URLs and last-modified dates.
	•	Access control: restrict who can merge PRs (CODEOWNERS or protected branches).

⸻

7 — Change detection & update automation
	•	Periodic job (GitHub Action or cron) does:
	•	Fetch Confluence page metadata (page id, lastmodified).
	•	Compare lastmodified or page content hash vs stored metadata/*.
	•	If changed, create PR in staging/ with diff and mark requires_approval.
	•	For Swagger files: maintain a hash of openapi.yaml; run a parser diff to detect added/removed paths → produce granular chunk diffs (per-path).

⸻

8 — Security & compliance notes (concise)
	•	Redact secrets before storing (API keys, PII). Implement regex-based redaction during ingestion.
	•	Keep .context repo access-limited to dev teams.
	•	Log all approvals and deletions for audit.

⸻

9 — Demo / Hackathon plan (quick)
	•	Repo with raw/ vs .context/ side-by-side.
	•	Show Copilot suggestions with and without .context (recorded demo).
	•	Metrics: suggestion relevance (qualitative), reduced time-to-code in 2–3 scenarios.

⸻

10 — Next concrete deliverables I can produce for you (pick any)
	•	Working Python script for Confluence ingestion + chunker (ready-to-run).
	•	GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled change detection + PR creation.
	•	Small approval UI (React + Flask) that writes approvals to repo.
	•	Example .context generator that converts OpenAPI paths into per-path chunks.

Tell me which of the deliverables you want first and I’ll generate the code/CI/workflow for that.
